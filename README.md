# gluetun-qbittorrent Port Manager

Automatically updates the listening port for qBittorrent to match the 
port forwarded by [Gluetun](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun/). This 
project is a fork of [SnoringDragon's gluetun-qbittorrent-port-manager](https://github.com/SnoringDragon/gluetun-qbittorrent-port-manager).

## Overview

[Gluetun](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun/) can forward ports for 
supported VPN providers, but qBittorrent lacks the ability to 
automatically update its listening port. In previous versions, the 
forwarded port was written to a file; however, with Gluetun v4, this 
file has been replaced by a Control Server API. This Docker 
container-based script periodically (by default every 30 seconds) 
retrieves the current forwarded port and the VPN public IP via the 
Control Server API, then automatically updates qBittorrent's listening 
port accordingly.

The script also performs a TCP port check using nmap to verify that the 
forwarded port is open. To handle cases when the TCP port is not open, 
three different modes have been implemented:

- OPENVPN mode:
  In this mode, if the TCP port check fails, the script will restart the
  VPN connection by sending API calls to Gluetun (using the OpenVPN API
  endpoints). This mode is ideal for setups using OpenVPN, where the 
  Gluetun Control Server supports VPN restarts.

- WIREGUARD mode:
  For WireGuard users, the Gluetun Control Server does not offer a 
  dedicated API to restart the VPN connection yet. Instead, if the TCP 
  port check fails in this mode, the script will shut down qBittorrent 
  via its WebUI API. This prevents qBittorrent from operating with a 
  non-functional TCP port until the issue can be addressed manually.

- DUMPMODE:
  Some users only require the forwarded port to be updated automatically,
  regardless of whether the TCP port is open. In dump mode, the script 
  updates the port if it has changed but skips the TCP port check 
  entirely. This mode is useful when only UDP connectivity is needed or
  if you prefer to manage TCP connectivity by other means.

## Important Note

You must integrate the provided `docker-compose.yml` configuration into 
your existing Docker Compose setup that includes Gluetun. Be sure to 
replace the default values with your specific settings; otherwise, the 
script will not function correctly.

## Manual Test

Before using this script, ensure that qBittorrent is properly connected 
to the forwarded port. You can confirm this if you see a green globe 
icon at the bottom of the qBittorrent WebUI.

## Setting Up Gluetun

Add the correct volume mounts to your [Gluetun](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun/) 
container. For example:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /docker/gluetunvpn:/gluetun
  - ./config/gluetun_auth_config.toml:/gluetun/auth/config.toml
```

Please see ([link](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun-wiki/blob/main/setup/advanced/control-server.md)) for specific instructions about setting up `config.toml`. This is 
*required* after the v3.40.0 release.

Enable the Control Server by setting the following environment variables
in your Gluetun container:

```yaml
environment:
  - CONTROL_SERVER=on
  - CONTROL_SERVER_ALLOW_CIDRS=192.168.1.0/24
```

Publish the Control Server Port. To make the Control Server externally 
accessible, map the internal port 8000 to a host port (e.g., 8000):

```yaml
ports:
  - 8000:8000/tcp  # Control Server (accessible externally via port 8000, first port external, second port internal)
```

## Setting Up Gluetun-qBittorrent Port Manager

Ensure that the correct volume is mounted so that the container can 
access any necessary shared data. For example:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /docker/gluetun:/tmp/gluetun
```

Within the container, this volume will be accessible at `/tmp/gluetun`.

### Environment Variables

Configure your Docker Compose file to include the qBittorrent connection
details as well as the Control Server URL and timing parameters. For 
example:

```yaml
environment:
  QBITTORRENT_SERVER: localhost         # IP address of your qBittorrent server (adjust as needed)
  QBITTORRENT_PORT: 8080                # Port on which qBittorrent is listening
  QBITTORRENT_USER: admin               # qBittorrent username
  QBITTORRENT_PASS: adminadmin          # qBittorrent password
  HTTP_S: http                          # Use "http" or "https" as required

  # Timing parameters
  CHECK_INTERVAL: 30                    # Interval (in seconds) for the update cycle (default: 30)
  WAIT_TIMEOUT: 60                      # Timeout (in seconds) for waiting on VPN status changes
  WAIT_INTERVAL: 5                      # Interval (in seconds) between VPN status checks

  # Control Server settings
  # The Control Server is assumed to be available at hostname "gluetun" on port 8000 within the # Docker network.
  CONTROL_SERVER_URL: http://gluetun:8000
  # https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun-wiki/blob/main/setup/advanced/control-server.md
  GLUETUN_AUTH_MODE: {none,basic,apikey}
  GLUETUN_AUTH_USERNAME: gluetunauth
  GLUETUN_AUTH_PASSWORD: gluetunpasswd
  GLUETUN_AUTH_APIKEY: gluetun_api_key

  # VPN Mode settings
  # Options: OPENVPN, WIREGUARD, or DUMPMODE
  VPNMODE: OPENVPN
```

With these settings in place, the script will dynamically update 
qBittorrent's listening port by querying the Gluetun Control Server for 
the current forwarded port and VPN public IP. It will then perform a 
health check using nmap and take action based on the selected VPN mode.

## Summary VPN modes

- OPENVPN mode: Restarts the VPN connection if the TCP port is not open.
- WIREGUARD mode: Shuts down qBittorrent if the TCP port is not open.
- DUMPMODE: Simply updates the port without performing a TCP port check.


This flexibility allows users to choose the behavior that best fits 
their VPN configuration and network requirements.

## When will WireGuard auto-restart be supported?

Automatic VPN restart in WireGuard mode will be supported once the 
corresponding API is implemented in Gluetun. You can track the 
[current status here](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun/issues/1113#issue-1345565765).
In the meantime, if the TCP port is not open, the script will shut down
qBittorrent. If you don't want this use mode `DUMPMODE`.
